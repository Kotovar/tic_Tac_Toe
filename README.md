# tic_Tac_Toe

tic_Tac_Toe is a web app that lets you play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with different options. You can choose from three modes of play: player vs player, player vs computer, and computer vs computer.

## How to use

To use tic_Tac_Toe, simply download project open the index.html file in your browser. You will see a game board with nine squares and a menu with options to select the mode and the symbol. You can click on the menu buttons to choose your preferences and start the game.

The game ends when one of the symbols has three in a row, column, or diagonal, or when there are no more empty squares.

## How it works

tic_Tac_Toe uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses pure JavaScript to handle the logic of the game and the user interface. 

The app uses event listeners to detect clicks on the board and the menu buttons. It uses switch statements to handle different modes and symbols. It uses Math.random function to generate random numbers for the computer move.
